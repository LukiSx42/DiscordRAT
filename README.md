### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
First you have to install the **required dependencies**, you can do so by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Next you need to **configure** the RAT.
If you are on Linux you will have to install Tkinter, you can do so by running `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` or `sudo pacman -S tk`
#### ‚öôÔ∏è Discord Bot Setup
You will need to create an __**discord app**__ (bot). You can do so by going [HERE](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Click on `New Application` and give it a name.
- On the left side choose `Bot`
- Create a new bot `Add Bot`
- Copy the Token with the button `Copy`
- Now you can replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` in the `client.py` with the token you just copied
- Click `OAuth2` then `URL Generator`
- Under `SCOPES` select `bot` (in the middle), under `BOT PERMISIONS` click `Administrator`
- Now copy the generated URL and visit the URL in a new tab
- Proceed to add the bot to your server
#### ‚öôÔ∏è Discord Server Setup
**On the server where you addded your bot:**
- Firstly, copy the server ID (right click on the server icon > `Copy ID`)
- In the `client.py` file, replace `YOUR_SERVER_ID` with the ID you copied
- Now, create a new empty category with any name

### üñ•Ô∏è Deployment
First I need specify that you can **only run** this script on the devices you have **premission** to test it on. If you don't, **I won't take any responsibility for the damage you will cause with this script.**
Now, with that in mind, you will need `pyinstaller` in order to build the RAT, you can **install** it with `pip install pyinstaller`.
Finaly, you can **build** it using `pyinstaller client.py -w --onefile` (the `-w` flag specifies that we don't need an terminal window when running the RAT).
